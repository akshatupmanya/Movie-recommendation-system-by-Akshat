# Movie Recommendation Project

Welcome to my movie recommendation project! In this project, I have utilized a dataset from Kaggle containing information on 5000 movies. The dataset includes details such as movie titles, genres, cast, crew, ratings, and more. The main goal of this project is to build a recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is obtained from Kaggle. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?select=tmdb_5000_credits.csv). It consists of two CSV files:
- `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`: Contains information about movie credits, including cast and crew.
- `tmdb_5000_movies.csv`: Contains detailed information about each movie, such as title, genres, budget, revenue, ratings, etc.

## Files
- `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`: This file is used to extract information about the cast and crew of each movie.
- `tmdb_5000_movies.csv`: This file contains detailed information about each movie, such as title, genres, budget, revenue, ratings, etc.
- `movie_recommendation.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and building the recommendation system.

## Recommendation System
The recommendation system implemented in this project is based on content-based filtering. It suggests movies to users by analyzing the attributes of movies they have previously rated or interacted with. Features such as genres, cast, crew, and keywords are used to compute the similarity between movies and recommend similar ones to the user.

## Usage
To run the recommendation system:
1. Download the dataset files from the provided Kaggle link.
2. Ensure you have opened the Googe Collab. go on file section and upload the dataset you have downloaded from the above kaggle link.
3. Open and run the `movie_recommendation_system.ipynb` in Collab Notebook.
